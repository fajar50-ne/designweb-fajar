		<h1>cultural awarness</h1>
		<p>
			Cultural awareness, or cultural sensitivity, is being aware that cultural differences and similarities exist, while not judging people based on that. A non-judgemental mindset lets you observe cultural differences without labelling them as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, or ‘right or wrong’.

			This doesn’t mean that you have to be an expert in other cultures. It just means being willing to be open-minded and to ask questions to get more information, rather than having a knee-jerk reaction to anything you don’t agree with.

		<h1>cultural indonesia</h1>
		<p>
			Indonesia is an open, friendly and peaceful country. Nevertheless, good cultural awareness will ease the culture shock and assure you avoid any unnecessary faux pas in daily life and business. Indonesians are taught from a very young age to remain calm in public, avoid disagreements, speak quietly with consideration and not get angered by little things. You should do the same. Adopt a humble demeanour, practice patience and remember to smile!

		<h1>ways to improve</h1>
		<p>1.learn from others</p>
		<p>One way I believe we can increase awareness is to have a better understanding of each other’s experiences. We live and work in a multicultural world that is rich in customs, culture, and diversity. Hopefully, as I do, you have friends and coworkers who come from various backgrounds. One simple thing we can do is go to lunch, happy hour, or invite someone into our home for dinner who is different from us in some way. </p>
		<p>2. understand history</p>
		<p>Another aspect of awareness is having accurate historical context. Understanding how things came to be can be done by reading the history of other racial groups or your community. When I first arrived in Baltimore, I often wondered why the city seemed to change block by block.</p>
		<p>3. visit cultural institutions</p>
		<p>Lastly, visiting cultural institutions in your community is a great resource to have a greater awareness of the rich culture of others.</p>
